# Aenzbi - AI-Powered Developer Platform Prototype

This project is an advanced, interactive frontend prototype for **Aenzbi**, a comprehensive developer platform. It is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and heavily features the **Google Gemini API** to create a dynamic, intelligent, and personalized user experience.

This prototype moves beyond static content, using AI to generate text, images, and even video in real-time, showcasing what a modern, AI-integrated web application can feel like.

## Key AI-Powered Features

-   **AI Search Assistant (Header):** The search bar acts as an intelligent assistant, providing direct answers to user queries about the platform.
-   **Personalized Hero (Homepage):** The main tagline can be dynamically regenerated by an AI to appeal to different developer personas.
-   **AI-Generated Content (All Pages):** All informational pages (e.g., about specific products like AenzbiStudio, POS, Mobile SDK) have their content dynamically generated by an AI, ensuring rich and relevant descriptions.
-   **AI-Generated Imagery (Platform Overview):** The main visual for the platform overview is generated in real-time by an image model, creating a unique visual identity.
-   **User-Guided Video Generation (Video Demo):** Users can provide a keyword to guide the AI in generating a short, tailored promotional video for the platform.
-   **AI Pricing Recommender (Pricing Page):** An interactive tool where users can describe their needs, and an AI will recommend the most suitable pricing plan.
-   **AI Testimonial Generator (Testimonials):** New, realistic testimonials can be generated on-demand to provide fresh social proof.
-   **AI Form Assistant (CTA Section):** Helps users draft a professional consultation request message based on simple keywords.
-   **AI Profile Customization (Profile Page):**
    -   **Avatar Generator:** Create a unique profile picture from a text description.
    -   **Bio Assistant:** Draft a professional bio from a few keywords.
-   **AI-Generated Notifications (Header):** The notification center is populated with realistic, AI-generated alerts to make the UI feel alive.
-   **AI Dashboard Summaries (Dashboard):** Provides intelligent, concise summaries of selected project statuses.

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **Environment:** Runs directly in the browser using ES Modules and an import map (no build step).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is designed to run in a specific browser-based environment where the Google GenAI SDK is available via an import map.

### Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key is expected to be available in the execution environment as `process.env.API_KEY`.

In a local development setup, you would typically create a file to define this variable. For this specific prototype environment, the key is assumed to be pre-configured and accessible.

**Important:** In a real-world production application, API keys must be kept secret on a secure backend server. They should never be exposed on the client-side.

### Running the Application

This prototype is loaded via the `index.html` file, which uses a module script (`index.tsx`) to start the React application. There is no local server or build step required; simply open `index.html` in a compatible web browser.
